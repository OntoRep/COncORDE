# COncORDE incident model

# Introduction

In COncORDE project incident information is represented with flexible ontological model that can be served as an intelligent context-aware semantic data store for the Incident related information [1].  Core concepts of incident model can be categorized with a vocabulary based on EDXL standard that provides various categorizations for concepts such as types of incidents and resources and organization participating it. Incident model is aligned with PROV-O ontology so that it supprots decision making by modelling by who, by which activity, when and based on which information the decisions was made [2].

Instructions on how to use this ontology together with  [EDXL vocabulary](https://github.com/OntoRep/EDXL) are provided in the wiki pages of this repository. Basic tutorial can be found from: https://github.com/OntoRep/COncORDE/wiki/Creating-an-incident-description.

## Visualization of current status

This document provides diagrams generated from Enterprice Architect ODM plugin and Protege OntoGraph plug-in, those may not reflect the latest status of vocabulary. A visualization of current snapshot of vocabulary can be found from:

# Overview of ontology

Main ontology classes for modelling incidents is presented in following diagram.

Incident is the core class that links together different knowledge elements and defines the main data structure of an emergency incident. As Incident can be associated with data from different sources that provide information about an emergency incident. The Incident model reuses various state of the art extenral ontologies such as ‘time:TemporalEntity’ and ‘geo:SpatialEntity’ concepts that are used to define start and end times and geographical locations of an incident.  The Incident core ontology is also aligned with PROV ontology so that the Role, Entity and Activity concepts are reused (sub-class relations classes not included into the diagram, are shown in the upper right corner of the boxes)

Modelling of incident participants is shown in the next diagram. Participant class models various emergency response related roles and actors are associated to a specific incident individual.

Resource class models participants needed for accomplishing different assignments in an emergency response scenario. COncCORDE incident ontology provides provides vocabularies for defining specific activities required by roles and matching thoses of profiles of persons and organization (i.e. agents) identified in the COncORDE project but not covered by EDXL standard.

Incident ontology also provides simple vocabulaires for environmental information such as weather using similar approach than EDXL vocabulary.



# Rationale for ontology design 

Ontology implementation (as also in EDXL vocabulary) uses design pattern where instead of direct subclassing a class is defined as a subclass edxl:Categorizable defined with edxl:hasCategory  with domain edxl:Category. Rationale is that this allows information providers for incident define what the category of incident or resource as opposed that the categorization would rely on reasoner classifier.

EDXL vocabulary is kept separate from incident model to allow independen development of those and better separate what is specific to COncORDE and what is defined by EDXL standard.

Modeling of incidents treats participants as somebody or a resource participating in a incident specific role. A role needed in incident can be defined before actual person, organization or resource to fulfill the role has been identified.

Decision making support in incident model relies on prov-o ontology so that quite refined proveneance information can be modelled. Prov-o is quite complex ontology so in typical use cases it might be better to select a subset of prov-o properties to clarify processing.
